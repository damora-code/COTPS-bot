<h3 align="center">COTPS Bot</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This script is created for the sole purpose of automating the process of creating, selling and confirming transactions on COTPS. Built with a timer, you can run the program and see where you are along in the cycle and when you should come back to check on your assets via the terminal window created when you run the program.
